# twyne-dashboards

Experimental dashboards and data exploration tools for the Twyne protocol. **Built primarily by AI (Claude) as rapid prototypes** — not production-grade software.

## What's here

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `aave-explorer.html` | Aave V3 Looping Simulator — yield matrix, E-mode browser, interactive leverage simulator |

## Important

- **Do not treat any data as authoritative.** Yields, rates, and calculations are approximations for exploration purposes only.
- **No guarantees on correctness.** Formulas may be simplified, edge cases unhandled, and data sources may be stale or unavailable.
- **Not financial advice.** This is a developer tool, not a trading interface.

## Running

Open any `.html` file directly in a browser. No build step, no dependencies to install. Data is fetched live from public RPC endpoints and DeFiLlama.
